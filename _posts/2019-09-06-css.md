## CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

CSS offers more control over layout

--

CSS rules consist of a selector followed by its associated style declarations within curly braces

--

A style rule is composed of property names and property values separated by colons, with each style declaration (property/value pairs) in turn being separated by semicolon

--

```
h1 {
  color: red; 
  font-size: xx-large;
  text-align: center;
}
```
